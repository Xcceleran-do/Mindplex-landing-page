![banner](./campaign/banner-1.png)

**Campaign Overview:** Mindplex is excited to announce a new giveaway campaign for **online users**! Your task is to help promote Mindplex content across various platforms using different strategies. By participating, you stand a chance to **Win up to 18,000 Birr**!

**Campaign Rules:**

Every month, 5 participants will be selected to share a prize pool of **18,000 Birr**! Winners will be chosen from a list of eligible candidates, with prizes awarded via TeleBirr or their preferred bank accounts. To be eligible, participants have to collect a minimum of 6 MPXR tokens.

**How to Participate:**

1. **Register** on Mindplex: Create your account [here](https://magazine.mindplex.ai). Join the Mindplex [Telegram](https://t.me/mindplex_ai).

2. **Complete Your Mindplex Profile**: Head to your profile page and finish setting it up.

3. **Explore Content**: Engage with articles, news, and podcasts in the Magazine, News, and Podcast sections.

4. **Interact for MPXR Rewards**: Comment, Like/Dislike, Share, Use Emoji Reactions, and start earning Mindplex Reputation Tokens (MPXR).

5. **Activate Your Mindplex Social**: Post content and interact with other users' posts on[Mindplex Social](https://magazine.mindplex.ai/social-feed/).

6. **Earn a Minimum of 6 MPXR**: Once you reach 6 MPXR, you are eligible for the giveaway. The more MPXR you earn, the higher your chances of winning!

7. **Daily Bonus**: Log in every day to earn extra MPXR points.

**How to Earn More MPXR:**

- **Quality Interactions**: Engage genuinely. Spend at least 55% of the required time consuming content before interacting to earn full rewards. **Timing Matters** and the read or listen time is listed on the content page so you can estimate your consumption.

- **Comment for Higher Rewards**: Comments provide the highest MPXR, followed by shares, emoji reactions, likes/dislikes, and social posts.

**Warning: Avoid System Manipulation**

To ensure fair participation and eligibility, do not try to game the system. Here are some key points:

1. Don’t Rush Interactions: If you interact with content (like, comment, share) before actually reading or listening to at least 10% of it, your MPXR reward will be reduced. For example, interacting before 1 minute of reading will result in zero MPXR.

2. Thoughtful Original Comments Only: Avoid generic or fake comments like “This is good” or “I agree.” These will be flagged by our AI as “Expedient,” and you will earn no points. Copying and pasting another user’s comment or your comment will lead to point deductions.

3. Avoid Meaningless Posts: Posting irrelevant content on the Mindplex Social such as “Hi”. “Good Morning”, “Great Project” etc. or random cat or dog or similar images will trigger our auto-deleting feature, and MPXR will be deducted. Posting copy-pasted contents from other media platforms will also result in auto deletion and point reduction. Only post meaningful and original content that contributes value to the Mindplex community.

4. Using multiple accounts won’t benefit you. First, if the system detects it, all your accounts will be automatically deleted. Second, instead of consolidating your MPXR in one account, you’ll spread your points across different accounts, weakening your competitive advantage.
